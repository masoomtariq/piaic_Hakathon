## **Getting Started**

Begin by **creating a new site**.

Alternatively, you can **try Docusaurus instantly** using **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### **What You’ll Need**

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version **20.0 or above**

  * During installation, it is recommended to select all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## **Generate a New Site**

Create a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**. The template will automatically set up your project with default configurations.

Run the following command in your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or your editor’s integrated terminal):

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

> This command installs all necessary dependencies required to run your Docusaurus site.

## **Start Your Site**

After generating the site, start the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

* The `cd my-website` command navigates into your project directory.
* The `npm run start` command builds your site locally and serves it through a development server.
* Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to view the site.
