# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

The future of work will increasingly involve seamless **collaboration between humans, intelligent agents (AI software), and robots**. This transformation will not eliminate jobs but will redefine human roles, creating a growing demand for new, specialized skills. This textbook is designed to provide a comprehensive foundation in **Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics**, equipping students with the knowledge and practical expertise to design, simulate, and control humanoid robots in both virtual and physical environments.

## **Course Overview**

**Focus and Theme:**
The course emphasizes **AI systems in the physical world** and the concept of **embodied intelligence**. Its primary goal is to bridge the gap between the **digital brain** and the **physical body**, enabling students to translate AI theory into real-world robotic applications.

**Capstone Quarter Objective:**
This quarter focuses on **Physical AI**—AI systems that operate in the real world while respecting physical laws. Students will gain hands-on experience in designing, simulating, and deploying humanoid robots capable of **natural human-robot interactions**, leveraging advanced platforms such as **ROS 2**, **Gazebo**, and **NVIDIA Isaac**.
