This shift won't necessarily eliminate jobs but will change what humans
do, leading to a massive demand for new skills. We have already written
a book on AI agents. Therefore, we want you to write a textbook to teach
a course in Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics (The course details are
documented below).

**Excel** **in** **the** **Hackathon** **and** **Launch** **Your**
**Journey** **as** **an** **AI** **Startup** **Founder** 🚀

We’ve recently launched **Panaversity** **(panaversity.org)**, an
initiative focused on teaching cutting-edge AI courses. Alongside this,
we’re working on publishing our first book, which you can explore at
**ai-native.panaversity.org**. Our next milestone is to build a portal
where authors can create AI-native technical textbooks, and readers can
easily access and learn from them using AI Agents. We also plan to
publish **O/A** **Level,** **Science,** **Engineering,** **and**
**Medical** AI-native books to support students and professionals across
disciplines. If you perform well in this hackathon, you may be invited
for an interview to join the **Panaversity** **core** **team** and
potentially step into the role of a **startup** **founder** within this
growing ecosystem. You will get a chance to work with Panaversity
founders Zia, Rehan, Junaid, and Wania and become the very best. You may
also get a chance to teach at Panaversity, PIAIC, and GIAIC.

**Why** **Physical** **AI** **Matters**

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because
they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from
interacting in human environments. This represents a significant
transition from AI models confined to digital environments to embodied
intelligence that operates in physical space.

**Hardware** **Requirements**

This course is technically demanding. It sits at the intersection of
three heavy computational loads: **Physics** **Simulation** (Isaac
Sim/Gazebo), **Visual** **Perception** (SLAM/Computer Vision), and
**Generative** **AI** (LLMs/VLA).

Because the capstone involves a "Simulated Humanoid," the primary
investment must be in **High-Performance** **Workstations**. However, to
fulfill the "Physical AI" promise, you also need **Edge** **Computing**
**Kits** (brains without bodies) or specific robot hardware.

**1.** **The** **"Digital** **Twin"** **Workstation** **(Required**
**per** **Student)**

This is the most critical component. NVIDIA Isaac Sim is an Omniverse
application that requires "RTX" (Ray Tracing) capabilities. Standard
laptops (MacBooks or non-RTX Windows machines) **will** **not**
**work**.

> ● **GPU** **(The** **Bottleneck):** NVIDIA **RTX** **4070** **Ti**
> **(12GB** **VRAM)** or higher. ○ *Why:* You need high VRAM to load the
> USD (Universal Scene
>
> Description) assets for the robot and environment, plus run the VLA
> (Vision-Language-Action) models simultaneously.
>
> 4
>
> ○ *Ideal:* RTX 3090 or 4090 (24GB VRAM) allows for smoother
> "Sim-to-Real" training.
>
> ● **CPU:** Intel Core i7 (13th Gen+) or AMD Ryzen 9.
>
> ○ *Why:* Physics calculations (Rigid Body Dynamics) in Gazebo/Isaac
> are CPU-intensive.
>
> ● **RAM:** **64** **GB** **DDR5** (32 GB is the absolute minimum, but
> will crash during complex scene rendering).
>
> ● **OS:** **Ubuntu** **22.04** **LTS**.
>
> ○ *Note:* While Isaac Sim runs on Windows, ROS 2 (Humble/Iron) is
> native to Linux. Dual-booting or dedicated Linux machines are
> mandatory for a friction-free experience.

**2.** **The** **"Physical** **AI"** **Edge** **Kit**

Since a full humanoid robot is expensive, students learn "Physical AI"
by setting up the *nervous* *system* on a desk before deploying it to a
robot. This kit covers Module 3 (Isaac ROS) and Module 4 (VLA).

> ● **The** **Brain:** **NVIDIA** **Jetson** **Orin** **Nano** (8GB) or
> **Orin** **NX** (16GB).
>
> ○ *Role:* This is the industry standard for embodied AI. Students will
> deploy their ROS 2 nodes here to understand resource constraints vs.
> their powerful workstations.
>
> ● **The** **Eyes** **(Vision):** **Intel** **RealSense** **D435i** or
> **D455**.
>
> ○ *Role:* Provides RGB (Color) and Depth (Distance) data. Essential
> for the VSLAM and Perception modules.
>
> ● **The** **Inner** **Ear** **(Balance):** Generic USB IMU (BNO055)
> (Often built into the RealSense D435i or Jetson boards, but a separate
> module helps teach IMU calibration).
>
> ● **Voice** **Interface:** A simple USB Microphone/Speaker array
> (e.g., ReSpeaker) for the "Voice-to-Action" Whisper integration.

**3.** **The** **Robot** **Lab**

For the "Physical" part of the course, you have three tiers of options
depending on budget.

**Option** **A:** **The** **"Proxy"** **Approach** **(Recommended**
**for** **Budget)**

Use a quadruped (dog) or a robotic arm as a proxy. The software
principles (ROS 2, VSLAM, Isaac Sim) transfer 90% effectively to
humanoids.

> ● **Robot:** **Unitree** **Go2** **Edu** (~\$1,800 - \$3,000).
>
> ● **Pros:** Highly durable, excellent ROS 2 support, affordable enough
> to have multiple units.
>
> ● **Cons:** Not a biped (humanoid).

**Option** **B:** **The** **"Miniature** **Humanoid"** **Approach**

> 5

Small, table-top humanoids.

> ● **Robot:** **Unitree** **H1** is too expensive (\$90k+), so look at
> **Unitree** **G1** (~\$16k) or **Robotis** **OP3** (older, but stable,
> ~\$12k).
>
> ● **Budget** **Alternative:** **Hiwonder** **TonyPi** **Pro**
> (~\$600).
>
> ○ *Warning:* The cheap kits (Hiwonder) usually run on Raspberry Pi,
> which **cannot** run NVIDIA Isaac ROS efficiently. You would use these
> only for kinematics (walking) and use the Jetson kits for AI.

**Option** **C:** **The** **"Premium"** **Lab** **(Sim-to-Real**
**specific)**

If the goal is to actually deploy the Capstone to a real humanoid:

> ● **Robot:** **Unitree** **G1** **Humanoid**.
>
> ○ *Why:* It is one of the few commercially available humanoids that
> can actually walk dynamically and has an SDK open enough for students
> to inject their own ROS 2 controllers.

**4.** **Summary** **of** **Architecture**

To teach this successfully, your lab infrastructure should look like
this:

||
||
||
||
||
||
||

If you do not have access to RTX-enabled workstations, we must
restructure the course to rely entirely on cloud-based instances (like
AWS RoboMaker or NVIDIA's

> 6

cloud delivery for Omniverse), though this introduces significant
latency and cost complexity.

Building a "Physical AI" lab is a significant investment. You will have
to choose between building a physical **On-Premise** **Lab** **at**
**Home** (High CapEx) versus running a **Cloud-Native** **Lab** (High
OpEx).

**Option** **2** **High** **OpEx:** **The** **"Ether"** **Lab**
**(Cloud-Native)**

*Best* *for:* *Rapid* *deployment,* *or* *students* *with* *weak*
*laptops.*

**1.** **Cloud** **Workstations** **(AWS/Azure)** Instead of buying PCs,
you rent instances.

> ● **Instance** **Type:** AWS **g5.2xlarge** (A10G GPU, 24GB VRAM) or
> **g6e.xlarge**. ● **Software:** NVIDIA Isaac Sim on Omniverse Cloud
> (requires specific AMI). ● **Cost** **Calculation:**
>
> ○ Instance cost: ~\$1.50/hour (spot/on-demand mix). ○ Usage: 10
> hours/week × 12 weeks = 120 hours.
>
> ○ Storage (EBS volumes for saving environments): ~\$25/quarter. ○
> **Total** **Cloud** **Bill:** **~\$205** **per** **quarter**.

**2.** **Local** **"Bridge"** **Hardware** You cannot eliminate hardware
entirely for "Physical AI." You still need the edge devices to deploy
the code physically.

> ● **Edge** **AI** **Kits:** You still need the Jetson Kit for the
> physical deployment phase. ○ **Cost:** **\$700** (One-time purchase).
>
> ● **Robot:** You still need one physical robot for the final demo. ○
> **Cost:** **\$3,000** (Unitree Go2 Standard).

**The** **Economy** **Jetson** **Student** **Kit**

*Best* *for:* *Learning* *ROS* *2,* *Basic* *Computer* *Vision,* *and*
*Sim-to-Real* *control.*

**3.** **The** **Latency** **Trap** **(Hidden** **Cost)**

> ● Simulating in the cloud works well, but *controlling* a real robot
> from a cloud instance is dangerous due to latency.
>
> ● *Solution:* Students train in the Cloud, download the model
> (weights), and flash it to the local Jetson kit.
